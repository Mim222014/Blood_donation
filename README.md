# Blood_donation
The Blood Donation Management System is a platform designed to connect voluntary blood donors with individuals in need of blood. Users can register as donors or seekers, with donors providing information like blood group, contact, and location, while seekers can request blood based on their requirements. The system includes an admin panel for managing donor and request data, allowing the admin to view, delete, or update records. Built using PHP and MySQL, the platform uses sessions for user authentication. It features a search function for seekers to find donors and logout functionality for users. The project uses a relational database structure, connecting users, donors, and requests with primary and foreign keys. The system is simple, responsive, and ideal for improving blood donation accessibility across Bangladesh.
